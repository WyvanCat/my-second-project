    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->

    <p class="introduction">
        In this project I will try to implement all the functions 
        that we've learned in the second lesson. I have a <br>life long dream of becoming a DJ. I made a website 
        to try to promote my work, so I will include a link<br> to that!
        It's made on Wix and people keep bashing me for using it, but  
        I really enjoyed working with Wix!</p>

    <!-- LISTS -->

    <p class="list-header"><b>It was:</p></b>
    <ol>

        <li>Easy to understand!</li>
        <li>Good for a creative person! (Plenty of cool material to use)</li>
        <li>Fun!</li>

    </ol>
    
    <p class="list-header"><b>But other people would tell me that:</p></b>
    <ul>

        <li>The SEO is really bad.</li>
        <li>It's expensive.</li>
        <li>Other things that I don't remember. :(</li>

    </ul>

    <!-- END OF LISTS -->
    
    <p class="introduction">
        
        I assume that in the future I won't have to deal with any of that anyway, 
        since I will be able to<br> make my own websites!</p>

        In case you're tired of my rambling, I will 
        take you back to the top of my page. I don't think 
        it will<br> make a difference since my page is so short, 
        but I tried. <b>I'm offering solutions because I care!</b>
